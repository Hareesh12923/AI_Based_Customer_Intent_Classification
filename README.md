# AI Based Customer Intent Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying customer intent from feedback or inquiries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. By accurately identifying customer intentions, this model aids customer service teams in enhancing customer experience through faster and more tailored responses.

## Features

- **Intent Classification**: Recognizes various customer intents, improving service personalization.
- **Automated Responses**: Allows for rapid responses to common queries, reducing support team workload.
- **Adaptability**: Model retraining enables flexibility across different customer support scenarios.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text preprocessing and intent recognition.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network models for classification, built using:
  - **NLTK**: For tokenization, stop-word removal, and text cleaning.
  - **TensorFlow**: Used to design and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for intent classification.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Pre-processing**:
   - Collects and preprocesses customer feedback.
   - Utilizes techniques like text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
2. **Model Training and Tuning**:
   - Builds and optimizes an ANN model for intent classification.
   - Adjusts hyperparameters and network layers to improve model accuracy.
3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploys the model in a customer support system.
   - Provides documentation for integration, training, and continuous improvement.

## Results

The model accurately classifies customer intents and predicts sentiment, providing useful insights to improve customer support interactions. It can be fine-tuned for specific domains with additional labeled data to further enhance accuracy.

## Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Chatbot Integration**: Deploy model within chatbot frameworks for instant support.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand the modelâ€™s capabilities to support multiple languages.
- **Continuous Learning Pipeline**: Enable the model to learn from new data over time to maintain accuracy.
