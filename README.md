Customer Intent Classification is an NLP and machine learning project designed to classify customer feedback into distinct intent categories, such as inquiries, complaints, and appreciation. By leveraging deep learning techniques and natural language processing, this model enhances customer service by providing personalized responses based on identified intents. Built using Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow, the model undergoes preprocessing steps including tokenization, vectorization, and embedding to analyze customer sentiments accurately. This project aims to improve customer support efficiency and effectiveness by automating the intent recognition process.
